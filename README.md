# Where did I end up?

Had to take a programming methodology course at Free University of Tbilisi, which was heavily inspired by Stanford's CS106A.

I ended up using a text editor an some bash scripts to complete my homework instead of a full-blown IDE.

This repo is for people who would like to replicate a similar environment
